## Elastic Cloud on Kubernetes (ECK)

This repository is meant to validate, demonstrate, and provide a starter for hosting the ECK operator on a VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid (TKG) cluster. Though TKG is a ubiquitous runtime for hosting Kubernetes on any platform, public cloud or on-premises, the validations outlined below were performed on vSphere 6.7u3.

The version of ECK used in the preparation of this repository was 1.2.1. Please refer to the [home page](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud-on-k8s/current/index.html) for additional information.
